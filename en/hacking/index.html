<p>I am an enthusiast of hacking, not to be confused with online piracy. It is difficult to give a definition of hacking and indeed many exist: I define hacking as the practice of studying a system extensively so that it can be exploited in an unexpected manner. Note that this definition does not include only computer context, but also social context, and indeed many studies exist on social hacking. Note furthermore that my definition is independent from a hacker's intention: in can apply to the case of an online pirate, as well as to the case of a bug bounty hunter, of a cybersecurity researcher, or of player on hacking platforms online.</p>
<p>I define myself as a <b>playing hacker</b>, as at the moment my main activity in the field consists in playing on the well known platforms <i>TryHackMe</i> and <i>Hack The Box</i>. Furthermore, I like reading articles and watching videos to learn and improve my knowledge and capacities in the field, and when I can I try to <b>contribute to research</b> (see for example this <a href="https://github.com/LiveOverflow/security-research/pull/3"><i>pull request</i></a> on GitHub).</p>
<p>Although I am still quite new to hacking, I have already joined some competitions (<i>Capture the flag</i>) with good results.</p>
