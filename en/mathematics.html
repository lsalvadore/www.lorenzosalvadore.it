</p>I have a <b>broad knowledge of mathematics</b>, as proved by my <b>bachelor degree (original Italian denomination: <i>laurea triennale</i>) gotten in 2018 from the University of Pisa</b>. Although I do not have higher degrees and although I do not work in mathematical research, I still consider myself a mathematician. But saying that I consider myself as such because of my bachelor degree is wrong, and indeed my mathematical activity is not limited to this degree.</p>
<p>I like reading <b>advanced mathematical texts</b>, prefering those written by some of the greatest mathematicians. Specifically, I find <b>John von Neumann's works</b> extremely interesting; I have read, among others, <i>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</i> (written in collaboration with Oskar Morgenstern) and  many <b>book and articles about automata and computers</b>. I also had occasion to read texts from Cauchy, Gauss, Hilbert and many others.</p>
<p>On the other hand I have to admit that I felt particularly badly at university. My personal impression is that the goal of academical world is to form mathematicians that can solve problems by memory, without stimulating <b>creativity (an essential quality for mathematicians)</b> and adopting reasoning methods that I consider wrong. As an example to clarify this last point, I would like to use the concept of "good definition". This is what is intended by a "good definition": first you give a name to the only object that satisfies some property, then you proove that there is indeed only one object that satisfies the property and thus that the definition works. I consider a logical error reasoning in this way and in this order: the correct method is instead to proove first that there is only one object that satisfies some property and only then give it a name. A concept of "good definition" would imply the existence of bad definitions, but there is nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>And I have often seen the same confusion in many contexts: proofs of theorems are interrupted to proove lemmas, reasonings are done backwards writing "because" instead of forward writing "then", consequences of theorems are analyzed before prooving them etc. I understand that the order prefered by academical environments might be more effective from a didactical point of view, and I also understand that mathematical research often needs to proceed non-linearly, although everything is later sorted systematically. But I do not like this method, I work differently, <b>I prefer linear and direct reasonings such as those that can be found in Nicolas Bourbaki's <i>Éléments de Mathématique</i></b>. Furthermore, this uneasiness brought me to <b>write my own <a href="https://github.com/lsalvadore/mathematical-notes">mathematical notes</a> (the sources of which are accessible on GitHub)</b>, a work in continuous evolution where a fundamental rule is indeed linearity; at the moment the notes are accessible only after compilation of sources and in Italian languages as they are not complete.</p>
<p><b>My mathematical formation is also very useful in my programming and hacking activities. Among other things, it allows me to write more efficient and complex programs, to understand more deeply cryptography problems, to compute more easily when a buffer overflow can occur.</b></p>
